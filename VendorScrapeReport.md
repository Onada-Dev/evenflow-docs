## How to Read This Report

| Column | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Products** | Total number of products pulled from this vendor |
| **Desc%** | Percentage of products with a written description (helps the AI understand and match products) |
| **Img%** | Percentage of products with a photo |
| **Dims%** | Percentage of products with dimensions (W x D x H) |
| **Price%** | Percentage of products with pricing info (many trade vendors hide prices) |
| **Mat%** | Percentage of products listing their material (wood, marble, iron, etc.) |
| **Fin%** | Percentage of products listing their finish (e.g. dark walnut, polished brass) |
| **Stock%** | Percentage of products with stock/availability info |

Dashes (—) mean the vendor's website doesn't publish that information, which is normal for trade-only vendors.

## Scraped Vendors — Data Needs Improvement

These vendors are in the database but have data gaps that may affect how well the AI can find and describe their products.

| Vendor | Products | Issue | Impact |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Surya | 19,761 | Product names are inventory codes (e.g. "AAM-008"). Vision enrichment has added descriptions. | Largest vendor by count. AI uses enriched descriptions for search. |
| Eastern Accents | 9,501 | Only 2% have dimensions despite selling bedding/pillows with sizes. | One of the biggest fabric vendors — dimension data would help. |
| Bernhardt | 5,871 | 14% missing descriptions, 30% missing photos. | One of the biggest furniture vendors — data is thinner than ideal. |
| Maxwell Fabrics | 7,449 | Only 5% have descriptions or images (listing-level data only). | Large catalog but very thin data. Needs re-scrape with detail pages. |
| Rowe Furniture | 1,840 | 26% missing photos. No pricing. | Some products won't display images. |
| Tomlinson Companies | 1,770 | 64% have descriptions/images (up from 16%). | Improved but still has gaps. |
| A&B Home | 251 | IP-blocked after 251 products. Site rate-limits aggressively. | Only partial data — retry needed after IP block expires. |
| Precedent Furniture | 299 | Zero product photos. No pricing. | Products searchable by name only, no images. |
| Tuuci | 135 | Only 22% have photos. No pricing. | Umbrella/shade vendor — limited display quality. |

## Scraped But Incomplete — Need Re-Scraping

These vendors technically have products in the database, but the data is so sparse or the count is so low that they need to be redone.

| Vendor | Products | Problem |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Artesia Collections | 480 | Broken — virtually no usable data (0% descriptions, images, or pricing) |
| Lexington Home Brands | 26 | Major vendor with thousands of products — only captured 26 |
| Sherrill Furniture | 18 | Major upholstery vendor — only 18 category pages captured, not individual products |
| McKinley Leather | 10 | Only 10 products captured |
| Style Upholstering | 11 | Only 11 products captured |
| Thibaut Design | 4 | Major fabric/wallcovering vendor — only 4 products |
| Duralee / Robert Allen | 50 | Large fabric house with thousands of products — only 50 captured |
| Christopher Guy | 63 | Luxury vendor — likely has hundreds more products |
| Gracie Studio | 50 | Likely has more — needs full catalog scrape |
| Peyton Webster | 57 | No descriptions or images — needs re-scrape |
| Rowley Company | 15 | Workroom supplies — likely has more, low priority |
| Phillips Scott | 1 | Only 1 product captured |
| Horizon Shades | 3 | Only 3 products captured |

## Not Scrapeable — Still Blocked

These vendors still cannot be scraped with automated tools.

| Vendor | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| Vanguard Furniture | Requires trade account login to access catalog |
| Global Views | Cloudflare security blocks automated access |
| Noir Furniture LA | Website requires login to access product catalog |

## Vendor Rankings by Category

**Lisa — please fill in the Rank column (1 = most important) for each vendor within each category. This will help us weight search results so the most important vendors appear first.**

A vendor can appear in multiple categories. That's expected.

## Progress Since Last Report (Feb 16)

### Newly Scraped Vendors

These 7 vendors were previously marked as "needs scraping" — all have now been completed (except A&B Home which is partially blocked).

| Vendor | Products | Scraper Type | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| HVL Group (Hudson Valley) | 7,459 | Custom API + HTML | 6 brands: Hudson Valley, Troy, Corbett, Mitzi, CSL, Sonneman |
| Bramble Co | 2,233 | REST API | Open ServiceStack API — rich data with dimensions, materials |
| Chelsea House | 2,076 | SuperCat platform | Decorative accessories, lighting, artwork, mirrors |
| Woodbridge Furniture | 1,245 | Magento GraphQL | Traditional furniture and case goods |
| Southern Home Inc. | 1,184 | WooCommerce Store API | Furniture and decor |
| Worlds Away | 951 | BigCommerce HTML | Furniture, lighting, mirrors, accessories. Includes dimensions and stock status. |
| A&B Home | 251 | WooCommerce HTML | Partially complete — site IP-blocked after 251 products. Will retry. |

### By the Numbers

| Metric | Feb 16 Report | Feb 20 Report | Change |
|--------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Total products | 139,405 | **154,804** | **+15,399** |
| Vendors with products | 58 | **65** | **+7** |
| Fully scraped vendors | 34 | **43** | **+9** |
| "Needs scraping" vendors | 7 | **0** | **-7** |
| Blocked vendors | 3 | **3** | No change |
| New products added | — | +15,399 | HVL, Bramble, Chelsea, Woodbridge, Southern, Worlds Away, A&B |

### What Was Fixed

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| HVL Group — was "login-gated" | **Scraped: 7,459 products** |
| Chelsea House — was "Cloudflare blocked" | **Scraped: 2,076 products** |
| Bramble Co — was "complex site" | **Scraped: 2,233 products** (open API found!) |
| Worlds Away — was "Cloudflare blocked" | **Scraped: 951 products** |
| Southern Home — was "Cloudflare blocked" | **Scraped: 1,184 products** |
| Woodbridge Furniture — was "DNS error" | **Scraped: 1,245 products** (URL was wrong) |
| A&B Home — was "password-protected" | **Partially scraped: 251 products** (IP blocked, retry pending) |
| Magento scraper price bug | **Fixed** — was showing $0 for some products |
| Magento placeholder images | **Fixed** — placeholder images now filtered out |

### What's Still Stuck

- **A&B Home** — IP-blocked after scraping 251 of ~7,500 products. Scraper reworked with longer delays (2s), session cookies, and retry logic. Will re-run once IP block expires.
- **Incomplete high-priority vendors** — Lexington (26), Sherrill (18), Thibaut (4), Duralee (50), Christopher Guy (63) still have minimal data
- **Cloudflare-blocked** — Global Views still returns 403
- **Login-gated** — Vanguard Furniture and Noir Furniture LA require trade credentials
- **Dimensions gap** — 14 vendors have dimensions on their sites that we're not capturing

---

## Summary

| Status | Vendors | Products |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Fully scraped (strong data) | 43 | 107,139 |
| Scraped (data needs improvement) | 9 | 46,877 |
| Incomplete (need re-scraping) | 13 | 788 |
| Blocked / not accessible | 3 | 0 |
| **Total** | **68** | **154,804** |

### Key Highlights

- **69% of products** (107,139) come from vendors with strong, complete data
- **15,399 new products** added since the Feb 16 report across 7 newly scraped vendors
- **Top 5 vendors by product count:** Surya (19,761), Four Hands (17,911), Wendover Art Group (10,000), Eastern Accents (9,501), Maxwell Fabrics (7,449)
- **HVL Group** is now the 6th largest vendor with 7,459 lighting products across 6 brands
- **Vision enrichment** has been run on 53,347 products using GPT-4o-mini to generate descriptions, colors, materials, and style tags from product images
- **Cohere Rerank** cross-encoder model improves search result relevance
- **Vendor diversity** is enforced in search results — max 2 products per vendor to ensure variety

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Retry A&B Home scrape** — IP block should expire within 24 hours; will re-run to get all ~7,500 products
2. **Re-scrape incomplete vendors** — Lexington, Sherrill, Thibaut, Duralee, and Christopher Guy are high-priority vendors with minimal data
3. **Capture dimensions** — 14 vendors have dimensions available that we're not currently scraping
4. **Improve Maxwell Fabrics** — 7,449 products but only listing-level data; need to scrape individual detail pages
5. **Consider headless browser** for Global Views (still Cloudflare-blocked) and Noir Furniture LA
6. **Trade account access** — Vanguard Furniture requires login credentials to scrape

## Action Items for Lisa

1. **Fill in the Rank column** in the "Vendor Rankings by Category" section above (1 = most important vendor in that category)
2. **Confirm Noir Furniture LA** — Is the login requirement new, or is there a public-facing catalog URL we should use?
3. **Vanguard Furniture** — Can you provide trade login credentials so we can scrape their catalog?
